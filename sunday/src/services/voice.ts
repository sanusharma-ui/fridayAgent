/**
 * Sunday's voice.
 *  - "speak":  reads speech bubbles aloud with a Windows text-to-speech voice,
 *              pitched up and sped up a little so he sounds small and cheerful.
 *              Falls back to babble when no system voice is available.
 *  - "babble": Animal-Crossing-style gibberish blips (no words).
 *  - "off":    silent.
 * Plus short spoken reactions to actions ("Wheee!", "Uh-oh!", "Yay!").
 * Uses only the operating system's built-in voices — nothing is downloaded or sent anywhere.
